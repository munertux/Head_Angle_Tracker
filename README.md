Head_Angle_Tracker is a tool designed to detect and analyze head rotation angles in real time using computer vision with MediaPipe. The project employs image processing analysis to identify and track head orientation, providing detailed information about its tilt and rotation in degrees on the X, Y, and Z axes.

Features:

Rotation Angle Detection: Measures head rotation angles in three dimensions.
Real-time Tracking: Provides continuous, real-time visualization of head orientation.
Intuitive Interface: Displays rotation angles and other relevant data directly in the graphical interface.
Customization: Configurable to fit different applications and scenarios.
Requirements:

-Python 3.11.6
-OpenCV
-MediaPipe
